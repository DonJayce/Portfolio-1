My story so far

Hello my name is Donovan, I previously worked in Physical Therapy as a Physical Therapist Assistant working with geriatrics recovering from physical ailments, and middle-aged individuals recovering from orthopedic surgeries. I also worked as a consultant and strength coach with high-school, college, and semi-professional athletes. I left the sports medicine world to increase my income and free-time significantly. I entered the software sales world and was successful in my goals, but lacked the same drive I had within my previous career. I have always engaged in data analytics within my previous career through reviewing research studies, monitoring patient case-loads and progress, monitoring athletes exposure to mechanical stress, and for fun with NBA and MLB statistics. I never knew how far Data Analytics goes, until I spoke to Data Analysts in various areas of the software industry. I already love spreadsheets, I have enjoyed learning Tableau and R. So why not work within a career that I already have a drive? I love using data to answer questions, and even questions that no one has thought. I believe my portfolio will demonstrate my ability to find answers and visualize them efficiently.
